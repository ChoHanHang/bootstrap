Typeahead is a AngularJS version of [Twitter Bootstrap typeahead plugin](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead)

This directive can be used to quickly create elegant typeheads with any form text input.

The version from this repository supports all of the original configuration parameters and additionally is well integrated with the AngularJS support for promises (`$q`).
The source function can return a promise and the typeahead will be filled in upon promise resolution.
